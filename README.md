📌 Spam Mail Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a Spam Mail Detection System using Machine Learning techniques.
The model classifies emails as Spam (0) or Ham (1) using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

🚀 Project Overview

Spam emails are a major issue in digital communication.
This project uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Logistic Regression to detect spam messages accurately.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains labeled email messages.

Two categories:

Spam (0)

Ham (1)

Text messages are converted into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow

Data Cleaning

Label Encoding (Spam → 0, Ham → 1)

Train-Test Split

Feature Extraction using TF-IDF

Model Training using Logistic Regression

Model Evaluation using Accuracy Score & Confusion Matrix
